                    the freedom to approach the project in the way that I wanted. I was 
                    grateful they trusted me to come up with the vision for the 
                    application and execute it.I was also excited to use the Vue.js 
                    framework for the first time.Vue and React share many similarities 
                    as well as some interesting differences.I 'm not ready to declare 
                    one better than the other yet, but I am excited to keep working 
                    with both."
