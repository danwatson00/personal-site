      <p>Hi, I'm Dan. Thank you for visiting my site! I am a web developer and 
      UI/UX designer based in Nashville, Tennessee. Since completing the six month 
      Front End Development and UI/UX Cohort at Nashville Software School in June of 
      2018, I have been working and gaining valuable experience as a full stack web 
      developer and designer.</p> 
      <p>Prior to that I owned my own business as a photographer and designer. and 
      have also worked full-time as a teacher. I received my Master of Fine Arts 
      degree in photography from the Savannah College of Art and Design and my 
      Bachelor of Arts in Studio Art and Communications from Clark University in 
      Worcester, Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>Working in all of these facets of the creative process has informed how I 
      approach web development. Development is very much a creative process, and 
      one that does not begin with coding. It begins with the user and understanding 
      their needs. I enjoy putting myself in the shoes of the user and determining 
      the best way to achieve their objectives. As developers, we are in the business 
      of helping people and solving problems. I am motivated by great challenges and 
      enjoy building apps that are intuitive and useful. Difficult problems are the 
      most satisfactory obstacles to overcome and reaching those goals with a team of 
      individuals is especially exciting. In my career, I hope to always continue 
      learning from my peers and growing through my passion for development and 
      design.</p>
